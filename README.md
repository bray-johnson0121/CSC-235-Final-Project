The automatic dog feeder is a user-friendly device designed to dispense a predetermined 
amount of dog food at scheduled intervals throughout the day. The feeder's programmable 
features allow for customization of feeding times and portion sizes, accommodating my dog's 
specific dietary requirements. These can be adjusted in the code by updating the feed times 
and updating the amount of time the motor runs.
